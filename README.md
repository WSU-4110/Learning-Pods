# Learning-Pods
Learning-Pods is a web application that allows parents and legal guardians to have the opportunity to continue to build their children’s education and social skills while keeping them safe during a pandemic.   It allows small groups to form meetups within a community.  Rather than put all the stress on one user of the group there will be a rotation of hosts within the group for the duration of the group’s length.
